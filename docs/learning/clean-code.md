# Clean Code

See [Clean Code typescript](/docs/standards/typescript/clean-code)

## Exercise

If you don't already have it clone the RAD [Express Boilerplate repository](https://github.com/radically-digital/example-express-boilerplate)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:radically-digital/example-express-boilerplate.git
```

Switch to the `messy-code` branch

```bash
git checkout messy-code
```

Spend some time (maximum 15 minutes) going through the codebase making improvements. You should find at least one example of messy code relating to most (but not all) topics highlighted here e.g. there should be at least one example of polluting the global namespace. Once you have done this run the tests and ensure they all pass. Please only investigate the production code TypeScript files for messy code.
