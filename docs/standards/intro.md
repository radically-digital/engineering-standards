We partner with our clients to ideate, design & build industry leading digital products.

## Welcome to our Engineering Standards.

It details the best ways we've found so far for how we make successful digital products. It's filled with things we've learned based on our own experiences.

It is a living document that everyone at Radically Digital can edit in a [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/radically-digital/radically-digital.github.io). This means that as we have grown and learned, our standards improve. It also means that it is incomplete and can only represent where we are today. We are constantly working on improving, and we seek to share what we've learned as we go.

We actively encourage sharing this with our clients and thus have licensed it under [MIT](https://github.com/radically-digital/radically-digital.github.io/LICENSE) so they may learn from and even fully adopt our standards.

We welcome both internal and external contributions - please [read our guidelines](https://github.com/radically-digital/radically-digital.github.io/CONTRIBUTING.md) or email us at [hello@radically.digital](mailto:hello@radically.digital).
