# Create a Common Module

Components like buttons, inputs and cards are used all over the place. Even if you’re not going with a module based structure it’s good to extract those.

You can see what common components you have even if you’re not using Storybook. It helps to avoid duplication. You don’t want everyone on the team to make their own version of a button. Unfortunately, this happens way too often because of badly structured projects.
