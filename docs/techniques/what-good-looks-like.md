# A Note on What Good Looks Like

You'll frequently hear people in RAD use the term 'what good looks like'. We go into our clients as experts in our field and so we want to show them exactly how great it is working with us. Usually (but not always) when we go into clients they are still on the journey towards a great engineering or agile culture. We strive to help them on these journeys by being shining examples of great practices, high quality and fantastic productivity. This is what is meant when we say we want to show them what good looks like.
