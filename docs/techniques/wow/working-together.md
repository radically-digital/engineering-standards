# Working together

## Continuous improvement

Radically Digital exists in a changing business environment and is itself building a shifting suite of services. Even over its
short lifetime, we've witnessed systems be conceived, grow beyond reasonable maintainabilty, and be abandoned or
fall out of favor. Since there's no end state (at least, that we know about), we try to be disciplined and
practiced at dealing with change.

**Big things don't ship.** To ship anything, it must first be made small. Large projects can be expedited not by
everyone combining efforts toward a grand vision, but by identifying the incremental, graceful steps that can be
taken _now_ in the correct direction.

To that end, we want to be able to **experiment quickly and easily**. A/B tests, feature flags, role-based access,
and robust metrics are investments that quickly help make new ideas more concrete.

The tools of change, including aggressive **refactoring**, **data migrations**, **frequent deploys**, and a robust
**test suite**, are essential. Obstacles such as slow tests, inconsistent tooling, or unreliable deploys can hamper
our efforts, so are worth significant investment despite being disconnected from user-facing features.

Finally, Radically Digital aims for a culture of continuous improvement to both code _and_ process. We try to share wins, teach
best practices and offer constructive feedback. Tools like lunch-and-learns,
[postmortems](https://github.com/danluu/post-mortems), [kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen) or
[retrospectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective) help us reflect on our own practices and make change.

## Coordinating between teams

Often there's tension between meeting a single product team's goals and building what could be shared or most
useful across the platform. We resist this dichotomy. Radically Digital's platform _is_ the cumulative work of its product
teams, and will only succeed when our efforts combine to enable higher and higher-level features rather than local
solutions.

When questions arise about worthwhile effort and investment, they can usually be resolved by respective teams
discussing trade-offs and agreeing. Often there are opportunities to join forces and/or make deliberate, short-term
compromises in pursuit of a healthful state.

## Documentation

Teams and projects change to adapt to business needs. Code repositories come and go as well, but usually more
slowly. The [project map](https://www.notion.so/artsy/17c4b550458a4cb8bcbf1b68060d63e6) aims to list all the
repositories that Radically Digital maintains, organized by the responsible team.

Product team [slack channels](https://artsy.slack.com) are usually the first stop for help in a given team's
area of responsibility.

See the [documentation playbook](06_documentation) for a discussion of where to document systems, processes, and so
on.
